=head1 NAME

Acme::Prime - Exotic reports on prime numbers


=head1 VERSION

This document describes Acme::Prime version 1.1.1


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Acme::Prime;

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use Acme::Prime;
    report( $param );					# report on $param
    
	use Acme::Prime qw{ :internal };
    $bool = _is_prime( $integer );		# true if $integer is prime
  

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Calculating prime numbers is a basic exercise of the programming student. 
This is my contribution. 

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

This module has one routine, C<report()>, which is exported by default. 
This routine takes one parameter, sanitizes it, checks to see if it is prime, 
and reports the result to STDOUT. 

The internal function _is_prime can be exported on demand but does no 
checking of its argument. 


=head1 INTERFACE 

=for author to fill in:
    Write a separate section listing the public components of the modules
    interface. These normally consist of either subroutines that may be
    exported, or methods that may be called on objects belonging to the
    classes provided by the module.


=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=for author to fill in:
    List every single error and warning message that the module can
    generate (even the ones that will "never happen"), with a full
    explanation of each problem, one or more likely causes, and any
    suggested remedies.

=over

=item C<< Usage: ./prime.pl 42
# Parameter must be an integer greater than 1. >>

The usage note is appended to all error messages. It is assumed that a script 
was used to call this module and that a parameter was (or should have been) 
passed in from the command line. The example parameter, B<42>, 
is, in this case, not the answer but the question. 

A number is mathematically prime if it has no divisors except itself and one. 
A number B<Q> has a divisor B<P> if: 
a) Both B<Q> and B<P> are integers (e.g., 42, not 22/7, not PI); and
b) B<Q> divided by B<P> has no remainder (i.e., C< Q % P == 0 >).
 
The special case of B<one> is defined to be neither prime nor composite. 
Mathematical primeness is not defined for zero or for negative integers.
Mathematical primeness is not defined for non-integers.

=item C<< No parameter given. >>

C<report()> was called without a parameter to examine. If a script 
was used to invoke this module, then perhaps no parameter was given on 
the command line. 

=item C<< $param is not greater than one. >>

Mathematical primeness is not defined for zero or for negative integers. 
The special case of B<one> is defined to be neither prime nor composite. 
C<report()> was called with an unacceptable parameter. 

=item C<< $param is not an integer. >>

Mathematical primeness is not defined for non-integers. 
C<report()> was called with an unacceptable parameter.

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

=for author to fill in:
    A full explanation of any configuration system(s) used by the
    module, including the names and locations of any configuration
    files, and the meaning of any environment variables or properties
    that can be set. These descriptions must also include details of any
    configuration language used.
  
Acme::Prime requires no configuration files or environment variables.


=head1 DEPENDENCIES

=for author to fill in:
    A list of all the other modules that this module relies upon,
    including any restrictions on versions, and an indication whether
    the module is part of the standard Perl distribution, part of the
    module's distribution, or must be installed separately. ]

=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

=for author to fill in:
    A list of any modules that this module cannot be used in conjunction
    with. This may be due to name conflicts in the interface, or
    competition for system or program resources, or due to internal
    limitations of Perl (for example, many modules that use source code
    filters are mutually incompatible).

None reported.

This module may be intentionally buggy. There is no point in reporting bugs.
